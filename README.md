# My webpage which is a game
On my webpage i uploaded this old game I made. It have only the fundamentals working as I put it to the side.

## About it
It was supposed to be a open world game where you spawn in a random location in an procedually generated world and build houses, 
train soldiers and extend your territory but everything cost resourses. You would also be able to write contracts with other players to collaborate; for example:
Give 5% of your food in exchange for harvesting in the other persons territory. It would emerge an interesting dynamic where bottom-up economical and social constructions
lay the fundaments of the world and divide it like an feodal society.
