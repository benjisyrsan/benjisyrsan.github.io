## ABOUT
After I made an 2D procedually generated map i couldn't figure out what the gameplay should be but after endless hours of moving around the map and discovering new shapes of environment I started to realise an gameplay. I had an red dot in the middle and it was fun to stay on water and avoid all land. That set the fundation for this game, which also is procedually generated.
